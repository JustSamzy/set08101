			Hello! My name is Samantha and I am 28 years old. I have recently been diagnosed with high functioning
			Autism which actually makes sense to me. I regularly come across quite insensitive and as ive been told
			many a time aggressive. It is not intentional, I am just a very upfront and blunt person. I say what is
			on my mind, mostly without my brain actually thinking if it is suitable, in line with the current conversation
			and so on. There are plenty of myths and misconceptions surrounding austim, a handy rescourse to read can be found
			through <a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/blog/11-myths-about-autism"> Autism Speaks </a> which dispells
			11 common myths about Autism.
			Along with studying full time at Napier, I also work part-time as a Bus Driver at <a href="https://uk.firstgroupcareers.com/skillsets/busdriver/"> First Bus </a>
			I enjoy driving, so even though it is a job I see it more as a paid hobby. I also enjoy reading and going to walks in my local area.
			I have a keen interest in autonomous buses, with the <a href="https://www.fusionproc.com/automated-vehicle-systems/projects/cavforth/"> CAVForth project </a> being local to me as well as the university.
			I dont really use social media very much, but I do have <a href="https://twitter.com/POW_ItsSamzy"> Twitter </a> if you want to give a follow.
			Music really does help me wind down, get into the zone and really helps me express myself, I enjoy going to live gigs which around 5 booked this year, COVID dependant of course.
			Well I think thats enough for now, feel free to use the buttons below to navigate either back to the index page or have a look at my education.
			Thanks for stopping by!
