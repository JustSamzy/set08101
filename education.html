			Before I came to Edinburgh Napier, I had orignally taken the route of studying vehicle maintenance and repair
			at <a href ="https://www.west-lothian.ac.uk/courses/course-finder/?page=1&filter-5106=5106"> West Lothian College </a> before progressing to Edinburgh College to study at City & Guilds level. However, the toxicity
			of the environment finally wore me down and I decided to persue other interests. I was approached by a lecturer in the
			Creative Arts department who encouraged me to look into Audio Visual Technology, so I did. Even though this was another
			male dominated field, AV Tech was encouraging females to join the field and it was a much more accepting environment.
			I progressed all the way to a HND in Audio Visual Technology before deciding it was time to take a break from education and
			get a job. This is where I fell back in love with computing and all things technology, as I worked in <a href ="https://www.maplin.co.uk/"> Maplin Electronics. </a>
			However, I got bored just working and ended up taking on extra responsibilities such as learning through First4Skills, becoming
			<a href="https://twitter.com/Maplin_EDB"> Twitter </a> and Smart Home champion, working in other stores across Scotland and getting promoted to Sales Team Leader. Without this amazing job,
			I dont think I would have taken the plunge to go back to College to study Computing and then university. Unforanately, as you are
			probably aware, Maplin fell into administration and I lost my job and it become an online only retailer eventually. So far, that job has been the best job I have ever had and it will be
			hard to beat! I have never felt ready or "smart enough" for university but studying Computing, something I am passionate about, going to
			university became less scary and more exciting. Coming to university when I did meant I could get a degree in <a href ="https://www.napier.ac.uk/courses/beng-hons-cybersecurity-and-forensics-undergraduate-fulltime"> Cyber and Forensics </a> which will
			in turn hopefully get me into the forensics field. So far I have completed Networked Services, Scripting for Cyber and Networks and Network Security
			and Cryptography. I am looking forward to completing my other classes with the intention of progress into the Honours degree.
